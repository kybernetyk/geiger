This is (mostly stolen) code which deals with interfacing with the `GQ GMC-300E Plus` geiger counter you can get for very cheap (90 Euros) on amazon.

Getting it to run should be pretty self explaining. Fix your udev rules, compile it and off you go. I use Arch btw. and it works on my machine(s).

kthxbye
